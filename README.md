# MyFirstAgent
AI agent modules for making q-learning and monte carlo tree search planning.
Designed for problems represented with pddlsim package (python).
My original code for final project of Intro to intelligent, cognitive & smart systems course.

**note** - `my_executive.py` is the to file run the agent but it is specifically meant for the excercise requirements and therefore use cautiously/ contact me for specific details.
