# MyFirstAgent
AI agent modules for making q-learning and monte carlo tree search planning.
Designed for problems represented with pddlsim package (python).
My original code for final project of Intro to intelligent, cognitive & smart systems course.

**note** - `my_executive.py` is the file to run the whole agent but it is specifically meant for the excercise requirements (the code is activated from external script) and therefore use cautiously / contact me for specific details.
